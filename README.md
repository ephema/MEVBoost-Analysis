Please refer to the blog post for a summary on the insights.

We analyzed MEV-Boost payment data since the merge on September 15, 2022 (roughly 5 million data points) to identify patterns of multi-block MEV and correlation between validators and builders. We looked into sequences of a builder proposing blocks for multiple slots in a row as well as sequences where the same validator and builder where producting the blocks. Additionally, we looked into the MEV-Boost payments to identify patterns in how multi-slot sequences are valued. Further, volatility data has been included as well to cross-check effects of high volatility.
